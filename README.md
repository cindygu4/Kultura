# Kultura
MHacks 12 Project

## Inspiration
Our inspiration was the lack of communication between people of different cultural backgrounds and beliefs. More specifically, the "us vs them" mentality that most people have today.

## What it does
Kultura aims to connect people with different cultural student organizations so that they can be more culturally aware

## What's next for Kultura
We are aiming to incorporate either Apple or Google Maps into our app and add overlays to it so that people can select specific regions as well as having the map's regions light up differently based on your cultural engagement.

## Built With
Swift, Xcode, Firebase
